            <h1>Tom Flint's Office</h1><br><p>The cuase of death looked obvious. Tom's eye implant seemed to have malfuctioned, but this cant just be it. I spoke to docter Flint just earlier in the day. <br> earlier in the day lay on his desk was confidential documents which seemed to be depicting new upgrades to be made to some bioenhancements, but they are not here now. The blood splatter is further from his body than is usually expected. There was writting on the wall written in what seemed to be blood. This killing was personal. </p>

            <h1>Dr. Flints implant</h1><br><p>With most of these bioenchancemnt releated deaths the cause of death has been due to faulty implants with the enhancemnt peaces themseves being flawed in some way, usually stemming from them being off baught and implanted the black market products and services. This one is perfect though. The serial codes seem somewhat familer.</p>

Most poeple here don't even know the meaning of the word baker. The good thing however, It is no trouble finding a parking space. Anyway, I have requested all the case files to be sent to my holoboard.</p>
